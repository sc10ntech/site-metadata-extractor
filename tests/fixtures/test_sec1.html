PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><I>Jazz Pharmaceuticals to own worldwide rights to defibrotide at closing </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><I>Investor conference call to be held today, July&nbsp;2 at 8:30 AM EDT/1:30 PM IST </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DUBLIN, July&nbsp;2, 2014 &#151; Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced that the company has signed a definitive agreement with Sigma-Tau
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sigma-Tau) under which a subsidiary of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Jazz) will acquire from Sigma-Tau rights to defibrotide in the United States (U.S.) and all other countries in the Americas. Sigma-Tau holds rights to market
defibrotide in the Americas under an agreement with Gentium S.p.A., which was acquired by Jazz earlier this year. Defibrotide is a novel product that is marketed by Jazz in the European Union (EU) under the name Defitelio<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for the treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in patients over one month of age undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) therapy. In the U.S., Jazz is working
with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the regulatory pathway for submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for the potential approval of defibrotide to treat patients with severe VOD. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the agreement, Sigma-Tau would receive an upfront payment of $75 million upon closing of the transaction. Sigma-Tau would be eligible to receive
milestone payments of $25 million upon the acceptance for filing by the FDA of the first NDA for defibrotide for VOD and up to an additional $150 million based on the timing of potential FDA approval of defibrotide for VOD. Jazz expects to fund the
transaction with cash on hand and that the transaction will close during the third quarter of 2014, subject to customary closing conditions, including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;The acquisition of the remaining worldwide rights to defibrotide is a strong strategic fit with our specialty focus and would continue
the momentum of our recent launch of Defitelio in the EU, further leveraging our global clinical and commercial expertise in hematology/oncology,&#148; said Bruce Cozadd, chairman and chief executive officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc. &#147;This
transaction supports our mission to improve care for patients with serious medical conditions, and we remain committed to making targeted investments to develop and bring to market differentiated treatments for patients.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;This transaction would not only strengthen our global presence, but also demonstrate our commitment to diversify and expand our U.S. commercial
portfolio with meaningful new therapies,&#148; said Russell Cox, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc. &#147;We look forward to ongoing discussions with the FDA as we continue our efforts toward submission
of an NDA for defibrotide in the U.S. Patients in the U.S. with severe VOD have a critical unmet medical need, and we believe that defibrotide has the potential to become an important treatment option for these patients.&#148; </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to its existing approved indication in the EU, defibrotide has the potential to be developed for approval in countries outside the EU and in other
indications. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug designation to treat and prevent VOD by the FDA, by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), orphan drug designation for the treatment of VOD
by the Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health, and Fast Track designation to treat severe VOD by the FDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the EU, please consult the Defitelio
summary of product characteristics before prescribing, particularly in relation to use of medicinal products that increase the risk of hemorrhage, concomitant systemic anticoagulant therapy, medicinal products that affect platelet aggregation, use
in patients who have or develop clinically significant acute bleeding requiring blood transfusion, and patients who have hemodynamic instability. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>
